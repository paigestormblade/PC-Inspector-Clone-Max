PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx is the new professional hard drive copying program from CONVAR. Using the new direct DMA support, data can be copied from hard drives in high speed mode with speeds up to 3.3 GB per minute. 

This high speed is achieved by PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx through intelligent inspection of the PC motherboard and the hard drive controller. The software independently determines the fastest data transmission rate and achieves these exceptional speeds through optimal utilization of the DMA chipset on the motherboard of your PC.

PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx can be started directly from a boot diskette. The copying process is always based on the physical drive and is independent of the file system (e.g. FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, HPFS, NTFS, Ext2, Reiser, etc.) or the number of partitions.

Question: Why doesn't PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx achieve transmission rates of 3.3 GB / minute for me? 

Answer: The transmission rate depends on several criteria. Our software is optimized for the following chipsets: 
Intel 82371
Intel 82801E
Intel 82801E
Intel 82801BA(M)
Intel 82801AA,AB
Intel 82801BA,DC 
VIA VT8233(A,C)
VIA VT8231 
VIA VT8235 
VIA VT82C68B 
VIA VT8233 

PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx also supports other chipsets; however, it may be that the high copying speed is not achieved with other chipsets. The data throughput of the hard drive and the cable used also play a role. PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx independently reduces the copying speed for hard drives with defective sectors. 

Question: Why is PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx faster than other programs? 
Answer: PC INSPECTOR™ clone-maxx uses command sets that utilize the full performance spectrum of your DMA chip
